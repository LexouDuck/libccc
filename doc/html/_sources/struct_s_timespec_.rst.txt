Detailed Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This struct is used to store a precise, arbitrary timestamp (smallest unit is nanoseconds)

This 'timespec' has an arbitrary begin point (typically the start of program execution, but it can be the last machine boot, among many other things). It is meant to be used measure intervals of time during program execution, by calling the 'clock()' function several times and comparing their outputs.

This struct is equivalent to the ISO C library's 'struct timespec', although it's sub-fields have different names: tv_sec -> sec tv_nsec -> nanosec
